The test involves Roots Trellis, Bedrock, and Sage for WordPress development and deployment. 

 

1) Configure your local development environment for Roots projects following this guide: https://roots.io/getting-started/docs/development-environment-recommendations/

 

2) Create a new Trellis project for local, staging, and production. Start with the following guide and reference the complete Trellis documentation for this task: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/installing-trellis/

 

Be sure to encrypt vault information as described in the “vault” section of the documentation.

 

3) Part of setting up Trellis is setting up Bedrock. Add Yoast SEO and Disable Comments to Bedrock using Composer. See this page in the documents for reference: https://roots.io/bedrock/docs/composer/

 

4) Within the new Trellis project, create a new theme using Sage as a starter following this documentation: https://roots.io/sage/docs/theme-installation/

 

Make some changes to the Sage theme (colors, sizes, fonts, etc) and build the project. 

 

5) Create a new GitHub repository and commit the whole Trellis project with its Sage theme. Send a link to the GitHub repository to Rebel for reference and review.
